<p class="p4"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being governed by the Catholic Church, a minority community, the school has the primary objective of educating the children of the community. However, we shall not spare any effort in rendering our service to all people, irrespective of caste and creed, so as to conserve their religion, language and culture.

<p class="p4"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education without decipline will lead to beating on the bush; directionless, wayless and careless actions. Therefore, in the school we inspire and instruct children to  be deciplined, well mannered and to be respectable individuals in the society. The students are given the awarness not to confine to the materialistic society and  yeild to their shortcomings, rather come up and face the life with bold spirit.</p>
<p class="p4"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The students are motivated to instill basic knowledge about rights and responsibilities to govern themselves and the society. They are reminded to keep a close  watch to the society and do what is right not yielding to the rough circumstancess in their life.</p>
<p class="p4"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our full concentration is to build up confidence in each and every child to enable him/her to march forward with never failing determination. Thus, we aim at moulding  individuals into intellectually and emotionally balanced personalities.</p>
